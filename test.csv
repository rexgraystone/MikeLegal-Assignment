additional Shares to the Investors or IQIT , as the case may be, at the lowest permissible price; or

Company to issue additional Equity Shares to the Investors  or IQIT , as th e case may be , at the 
lowest permissible price under Applicable Law, so as to ensure that, upon issue of such additional 
Equity Shares, its holding in the Company is not diluted.

requirement of Applicable Law or otherwise to participate in relation to any issue of Shares to the 
Investors  or IQIT under this Schedule, then such Shareholder hereby waives all such rights and, 
to the extent it cannot waive such rights it agrees not to exercise them.  
 
(b) Ensuring Economic Effect . If for any reason any part of Clause  1 of this Schedule is not fully 
effected as a result of any change in Applicable Law (including a change in Applicable Law that 
affects the price at which the Investors or IQIT may sell or be issued Shares) then each 
Shareholder and the Company shall each use its best efforts to take all  such actions (by corporate, 
director or shareholder action) as may be necessary to provide to the Investors or IQIT, as the 
case may be, the same economic benefits as are contemplated by this Schedule.

omission, the Investors are unable to be issued the number and percentage of Equity Shares or 
Equity Shares at a price contemplated by this Schedule then that Shareho lder is deemed to have

additional Shares to the Investors or IQIT , as the case may be, at the lowest permissible price; or

is credited or paid out at time of rea l estate closing. The house a resident may purchase and apply 
the homebuyers account towards can be selected from either the same residence in this 
agreement or a home offered from ___________________________________________.  
Please note that the money tot al increases each month with every on -time payment received by 
the following due date: 15th. If, however, payment is received late, the total money accrued into 
the homebuyers account up to that point becomes null and void. The account starts again to 
accumulate with the next on -time rental payment. Residents further understand and agree that 
residents are:  
1) Responsible for handling all minor repairs, subject to the resident paying the first $100 of any 
repair, unless the repair is needed because of the n egligence of the owner or manager. In that 
case the owner is responsible for the total cost of the repair.  
2) To pass semiannual property inspections, and  
3) To annually attend a maintenance class or training offered to residents.  
By meeting those three re quirements, residents will receive an additional $60 every 6 months 
(following each inspection) added toward their home buyers account. Two property inspections 
are conducted yearly with a checklist provided to residents in advance of inspections. Failure to 
handle minor repairs or failure to pass a property inspection nullifies the total amount 
accumulated up to that point in the resident's Future Homebuyers Account.

44) FREE UPGRADE REFERRAL:  The owner agrees to offer a free property upgr ade once a

every six months and the owner will provide residents with a copy of a GOOD performance 
report when so e arned. Good reports are earned by residents who pay on time and follow ALL 
terms of the rental agreement. Residents can then give copies of their report to future landlords, 
loan officers, banks and mortgage companies. These reports may be beneficial in he lping you 
rent or buy a car or house in the future. Building your credit reputation may also help residents 
participating in the Future Homebuyers Program. Please note; a poor payment performance and 
any judgments are reported to national credit agencies a nd will be made available to future 
landlords, banks and other creditors who residents may want to do business with in the future. 
Therefore, it is important that residents understand that the credit they establish with the owner 
and the reputation they de velop through performance reports during the rental term (good or bad) 
can follow residents for many years. Because of such importance of performances reported, a 
resident will always be notified when a nonpayment or rental violation occurs and the residen t 
will be given an opportunity to immediately correct any poor performance before it is reported.
